FINAL RUBRIC 

THE FINDINGS

The njhome_floodsummary csv was used as dataset and whole Machine Learning Project was done in ML_Pricedrop.ipynb
the Data was was processed using Pandas dataframe it has (2 cities and 2 counties ) through year 2011-2022 the data of Precipitation and home price
is in the CSV. 
Input is independent variable is  Precipitation(anamoly pct)and house Price drop ("Y" or "N") is projected over years.

As the output is "YES" and "NO" kind, so itb falls under  Supervised ,Binary classification category. 

In Rubric 2 -LOGISTIC REGRESSION,DECISION TREE,RANDOM FOREST different regression is used to predict(with available data)
(please see findings in the  slide)

In final- 

The njhome_floodsummary csv was updated 

and we got CURRENTACCURACY SCORE for VARIOUS alogorithms
by minimising/reframing on X_train.shape

1.LOGISTIC REGRESSION-0.5912408759124088
2.DECISION TREE-0.8102189781021898
3.RANDOM FOREST -0.8321167883211679 (Using the equation (TP + TN) / Total, we can determine our accuracy)- this gave more accuracy model 



so keeping RANDOM FOREST basic classification algorithms .

Tablaue shows the output with Price drops VS Anomaly pct
