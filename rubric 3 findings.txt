RUBRIC 3



The njhome_floodsummary csv was used as dataset and whole Machine Learning Project was done in ML_Pricedrop.ipynb
the Data was was processed using Pandas dataframe it has (2 cities and 2 counties ) through year 2011-2022 the data of Precipitation and home price
is in the CSV. 
Input is independent variable is  Precipitation(anamoly pct)and house Price drop ("Y" or "N") is projected over years.

As the output is "YES" and "NO" kind, so itb falls under  Supervised ,Binary classification category. 

In Rubric 2 -LOGISTIC REGRESSION,DECISION TREE,RANDOM FOREST different regression is used to predict(with available data)
(please see findings in the first slide)

In Rubric 3- 

The njhome_floodsummary csv was updated 

and we got CURRENTACCURACY SCORE for VARIOUS alogorithms

1.LOGISTIC REGRESSION-0.5766423357664233
2.DECISION TREE-0.7883211678832117
3.RANDOM FOREST -1.0 (Using the equation (TP + TN) / Total, we can determine our accuracy)-but thisis unrealistic so droping this model 



so keeping DECISION TREE basic classification algorithms .

Tablaue shows the output with Price drops VS Anomaly pct
