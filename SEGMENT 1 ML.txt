STROM/RAIN FLOOD PREDICTION ALONG RARITAN RIVER MODEL ( REFLECTING FLOOD (y /n) and HOUSE PRICE CHANGE)

SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING


4 csv
2 csv of flood event(rainfall csv( event IDA and Sandy) -flood zone column,rainfall column
2 csv of before and after strom house Price change(zillow) -flood zone column

The final csv is the HomeValue_FloodSummary.csv (train.csv)

Columns include:

1.zipcodes
2.YEAR-strom event
3 JAN-DEC rainfall
3.Annual rainfall/storm(input)
4.floodzone-(this is output -flood y/n)
5.Avg single home Price.this column will show changes
6.Price Drop (outcome) 


steps use-(SUPERVISED  MACHINE LEARNING ) 
1.classification
2.logistic regression
3. ensembling

the main concept will be 
from inches of rain and strom data the zipcode areas flood or not 
data['Price Drop'].replace(['YES','NO'],[1,0],inplace=True)

y_predict = will be 
printing('Predicted drop in price') in those zip codes
printing('Actual drop of price')in those zip codes
the column of singlehome will show the price change
